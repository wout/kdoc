Title: Layout and Other Style

----

Text: 

This theme is a very simple and standard Kirby 2.0 type theme. It intentionally uses as little as possible, so that there's not a lot to learn on top of (link: https://getkirby.com/docs/templates text: Kirby template customization) in general.

The theme has only one template (default) and three snippets (header, footer, sidebar).

## Add CSS
The included npm local build tool does SCSS processing, which happens to the */assets/scss/main.scss* file. You can add more SCSS files and reference them in main.scss. 

The main.scss file just imports the SCSS files you'll want:

```
@import "normalize";
@import "highlightjs/railscasts";
@import "primary";
// you could add more file imports to this file
```

## Or not
You can also just ignore all this and use the included rendered CSS file. If you go this route, you won't need to do any SCSS processing.
