This theme supports code blocks the same way as Kirby always has, using three ` marks before and after, but it also enhances the display of those code blocks using (link: https://highlightjs.org text: highlight.js).

Here's what it looks like with the default theme included ("railscasts"):
```
.a-class-name {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

#something{
  color:red;
}
```
If you want to change the color scheme, highlight.js has (link: https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js/tree/master/src/styles text: quite a number of options), any of which can be downloaded and put into **/assets/scss/highlightjs/**, change the extension to **.scss** and and then reference from **/assets/scss/main.scss**.
