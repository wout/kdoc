Title: How to get started

## Method 1: Without Node JS
Do this if you don't want the overhead of Node JS, and either don't plan on customizing CSS, or have your own tools to process SCSS. 

1. Download or clone repo into a PHP compatible local host environment (see (link: https://getkirby.com/docs/installation text: Kirby install details))
2. There is no step 2.

## Method 2: With Node JS
Do this if you already have (link: https://nodejs.org/ text: Node.js). It creates a nice little self-contained environment for development that includes SCSS auto-processing with file watch and local hosting with PHP support. This has only been tested in OS X 10.11.

1. Download or clone this repo
2. In terminal run  *npm install* to get a small local build setup, this requires. You only need to do this the first time.
3. Run *npm run dev*  which should open up your default browser with the site running!
